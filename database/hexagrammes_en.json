  "texte" : "The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines.  These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit.  The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy.  Its image is heaven.  Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion.  Time is regarded as the basis of this motion.  Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.\nThe power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men.  In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity.  In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.",

    "sentence" : "THE CREATIVE works sublime success,\nFurthering through perseverance.",
    "explic" : "According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of success, power to further, perseverance] are paired.  When an individual draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what is right.\nThe specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of speculation at an early date.  The Chinese word here rendered by \"sublime\" means literally \"head,\" \"origin,\" \"great. \" This is why Confucius says in explaining it: \"Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings owe their beginning to it.  This power permeates all heaven. \" For this attribute inheres in the other three as well.\nThe beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to become real.  But the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these archetypes of ideas.  This is indicated in the word success, and the process is represented by an image from nature: \"The clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms. \"\nApplied to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable success: \"Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on sic dragons. \" The six steps are the six different positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon symbol.  Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time.  Thus each step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next.  Time is no longer a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.\nThe act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation of form.  This is expressed in the two terms \"furthering\" (literally, \"creating that which accords with the nature of a given being\") and \"persevering\" (literally, \"correct and firm\").  \"The course of the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony.  Thus does it show itself to further through perseverance. \"\nIn relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in creating order: \"He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace. \"\nAnother line of speculation goes still further in separating the words \"sublime,\" \"success,\" \"furthering,\" \"perseverance,\" and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity.  To sublimity, which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love.  To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful.  The attribute furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and which constitutes his happiness.  The attribute perseverance is correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can therefore bring about enduring conditions.  These speculations, already broached in the commentary called Wên Yen , later formed the bridge connecting the philosophy of the \"five stages (elements) of change,\" as laid down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles.  In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism."

    "sentence" : "The movement of heaven is full of power.\nThus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.",
    "explic" : "Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven.  One complete revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means that each day is followed by another.  This creates the idea of time.  Since it is the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course.  This duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative.\nWith this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so that his influence may endure.  He must make himself strong in every way, by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading.  Thus he attains that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his activity."

      "explic" : "In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in the Western world.  The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm.  In winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning.  As a result the creative forces on earth begin to stir again.\nHere this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect.  In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized.  Nonetheless he remains true to himself.  He does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time.  Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience.  The time will fulfill itself.   One need not fear lest strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe."

But danger lurks here at the place of transition from lowliness to the heights.  Many a great man has been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their course.

The attribute of the\nhexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of\nTHE CREATIVE–the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does\nnot combat the Creative but completes it.  It represents nature in contrast to\nspirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal\nas against the male-paternal.  However, as applied to human affairs, the\nprinciple of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation\nbetween man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and\nbetween father and son.  Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears\nin the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.\nBut strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly\ndefined hierarchic relationship between the two principles.  In itself of course\nthe Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of\ndevotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the\nCreative.  For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it\nis productive of good.

    "explic" : "The four fundamental aspects of the Creative–\"sublime success, furthering\nthrough perseverance\"–are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however,\nthe perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare.  The Receptive\nconnotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative.\nThe potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a\nspecifically qualifying definition.  Thus the qualification, \"of a mare,\" is here\nadded to the idea of perseverance.  The horse belongs to earth just as the\ndragon belongs to heaven.  Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a\nsymbol of the vast expanse of the earth.  This is the symbol chosen because\nthe mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the\ngentleness and devotion of the cow.\nOnly because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad\nimpulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real.  Nature's richness\nlies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to\ngive then beauty and splendor.  Thus it prospers all that lives.  It is the\nCreative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive.\nApplied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in\nconformity with the situation.  The person in questions not in an\nindependent position, but is acting as an assistant.  This means that he must\nachieve something.  It is not his task to try to lead–that would only make him\nlose the way–but to let himself be led.  If he knows how to meet fate with an\nattitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance.  The superior man\nlets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the\nsituation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from\nfate.\nSince there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in\nthe hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set.  The\ntime of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south\nsymbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature\ndoes in summer and autumn.  If in that situation one does not mobilize all\none's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done.  Hence to find\nfriends there means to find guidance.  But in addition to the time of toil and\neffort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude.  The\neast symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and\nthe north the place where he reports on what he has done.  At that time he\nmust be alone and objective.  In this sacred hour he must do without\ncompanions.  So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional\nhates and favoritism."

In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes\nand solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and\ncubic magnitudes from rectangular planes.

Only\nthus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.\nA teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite\nlike that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key\nfor resolution of doubts and a basis for decision.  If mistrustful or\nunintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher.

Therefore let him who wishes to gather others\nabout him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone\nattempting the task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse\nthan if no union at all had taken place.\nBut when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or\nuncertain gradually come in of their own accord.  Late-comers must suffer the\nconsequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is also\nimportant.  Relationships are formed and firmly established according to\ndefinite inner laws.  Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who\ncomes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a\nstraggler, he finds the door locked.\nIf a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong\nenough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some\nother organic fellowship."

The ruler\nwho revered the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of\nHeaven, in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical\ncontact.\nThese ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture.  Confucius has said\nof the great sacrifice at which these rites were performed: \"He who could\nwholly comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were\nspinning on his hand. \""

First, resolution must be\nbased on a union of strength and friendliness.  Second, a compromise with\nevil is not possible; evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited.\nNor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed over.  Third, the\nstruggle must not be carried on directly by force.  If evil is branded, it thinks of\nweapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose\nin the end because thus we ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion.\nTherefore it is important to begin at home, to be on guard in our own persons\nagainst the faults we have branded.  In this way, finding no opponent, the\nsharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled.  For the same reasons we\nshould not combat our own faults directly.

Only the most extreme caution can prevent\ndamage.  In life too there are junctures when all forces are in balance and\nwork in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best of order.  In such\ntimes only the sage recognizes the moments that bode danger and knows how\nto banish it by means of timely precautions."

      "explic" : "When a woman drove out in her carriage, she had a curtain that hid her\nfrom the glances of the curious.  It was regarded as a breach of propriety to\ndrive on if this curtain was lost.   Applied to public life, this means that a man\nwho wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the\nauthorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection.\nEspecially in times \"after completion\" it may happen that those who have\ncome to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble\nthemselves about fostering new talent.\nThis as a rule results in office seeking.  If a man's superiors withhold their\ntrust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing\nattention to himself.  We are warned against such an unworthy procedure:\n\"Do not seek it. \" Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait\ntranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts.

      "explic" : "\"Illustrious Ancestor\" is the dynastic title of the Emperor Wu Ting of the Yin\ndynasty.  After putting his realm in order with a strong hand, he waged long\ncolonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied the northern\nborderland with constant threat of incursions.\nThe situation described is as follows.  After times of completion, when a\nnew power has arisen and everything within the country has been set in\norder, a period of colonial expansion almost inevitably follows.  Then as a\nrule long-drawn-out struggles must be reckoned with.  For this reason, a\ncorrect colonial policy is especially important.  The territory won at such bitter\ncost must not be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or\nanother have made themselves impossible at home, but who are thought to\nbe quite good enough for the colonies.  Such a policy ruins at the outset any\nchance of success.  This holds true in small as well as large matters, because it\nis not only rising states that carry on a colonial policy; the urge to expand,\nwith its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious\nundertaking."
